# Mastermind

A playable mastermind game on the command line. 
Created for the Odin Project

This project includes an adaptation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)#Worst_case:_Five-guess_algorithm" target="_blank">algorithm</a> created by Donald Knuth in 1977. The algorithm in this project does not use the minimax technique to chose guesses.
